Starting with section1, learning and eventually building a static info site with react

JSX should always be wrapped in one element!

JSX returns plain JS objects
So the job of the React is to take the JSX elements and turn them into Real DOM elements such that browser can interpret it easily.
- if you normally try to write JSX and append it to the root element (good ol days), then it will give a string, then you stringify it and get the JS object, but not the real dom object as expected-react will do that for us

Need to keep these 2 things in mind while working with functions as React components:
1. we need to use Pascal case instead of camelCase for our component names
2. instead of using the function(), we use angle brackets here - <Function />

React components? 
function that returns react elements

React Elements?
RE are the objects that get returned with JSX [JSX is a syntax for react which returns js objects under the hood which react turns into real dom elements that we can render on the screen]

Call your component === Create an instance of your component


PARENT CHILD COMPONENTS
in this, it is explained that a <div> </div> cam have child components like
<Header />
<MainContent />
<Footer />

STYLING WITH CSS
just styling in css file and linking that css file with the keyword import

ORGANISING COMPONENTS
Moving the separate react components to their respective files and then using the 'export-import' statements

RUN LOCALLY WITH REACT
we setup a project using Vite here, just three cmds:
npm create vite@latest
npm install
npm run dev
